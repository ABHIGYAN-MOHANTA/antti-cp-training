This repository is my personal playground for the sport of competitive programming! 🚀 Here, I work through Antti Laaksonen's [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf), solving problems and implementing algorithms purely for the joy of the challenge and the thrill of problem-solving.

I'm doing this because I love the intellectual challenge and the satisfaction that comes from crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. No pressure, no competition (except with myself) - just pure programming fun! 🎯

## 📚 About the Book
